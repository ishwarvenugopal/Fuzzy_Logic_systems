# Fuzzy_Logic_systems

#### Note: Read Robotics_Report.pdf for a complete description and analyis of the model used. 

Programs developed in C++ as part of the CE801:Intelligent Systems and Robotics course at the University of Essex

There are two separate programs to

1) create a PID controller for a right-edge following behaviour on a mobile robot

2) create a fuzzy logic control system for a right-edge following behaviour with obstacle avoidance on a mobile robot, and demonstrate concepts like subsumption and context blending
